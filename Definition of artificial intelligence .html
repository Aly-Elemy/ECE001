        <h1><u><i>Definition of artificial intelligence:-</i></u></h1>
        <p>Industrial intelligence is a software package and not an electrical device, designed to make <br>
            the machine able to achieve a specific goal in a way similar to humans or sometimes beyond <br>
            the ability of humans. AI consists of a set of different goals and capabilities to include  <br>
            the ability to learn, organize and understand science<br>
            <h3><i>Artificial intelligence (AI): -</i></h3>
             the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to <br>
            perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the <br>
            project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans,<br>
             such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Since<br>
              the development of the digital computer in the 1940s, it has been demonstrated that computers<br>
             can be programmed to carry out very complex tasks there are as yet no programs that can match <br>
             human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge. On the<br>
             other hand, some programs have attained the performance levels of human experts and professionals <br>
             in performing certain specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense is<br>
             found in applications as diverse as medical diagnosis, computer search engines, and voice or handwriting <br>
                 recognition.</p>
