            <ol type="1">(1	There is no place for emotions: all human perceptions of conscience, mercy and collective spirit will disappear, meaning that machines can perform many tasks without there being links with humans,</ol>
            <ol type="2">(2	Unemployment: A person cannot match the machine in terms of efficiency, and thus machines will replace humans in various practical fields, which increases the unemployment rate.</ol>
            <ol type="3">(3	High cost: Working in this field requires a lot of money both in the machinery manufacturing processes, programming and repair.</ol>
            <ol type="4">(4	Data loss: Despite the tremendous memory that such machines may have, there will be no correlation between this information when it is stored and retrieved as humans do, and some damage to the machine can lead to the loss of all data stored on it.</ol>
            <ol type="5">(5	Monotony: These machines cannot go out of the ordinary and create something new as a person does, so their uses in the scientific and technical fields remain unhelpful in the arts.</ol>
            <ol type="6">(6	Wrong use: As many inventions invented by scientists for important purposes, but when they fell into the wrong hands, they were exploited for wars, and the exploitation of artificial intelligence for unscientific purposes and not serving society posed a real threat.</ol>
