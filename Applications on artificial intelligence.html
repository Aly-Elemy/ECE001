        <p>Artificial intelligence has been used successfully in a wide range of areas<br>
             including expert systems, natural language processing, voice recognition,<br>
              image discrimination and image analysis as well as medical diagnostics, <br>
              stock trading, automated control, law, scientific discoveries, video games,<br>
               toys and search engines on the Internet.  Often times, when the use of <br>
               technology expands and is not seen as an artificial intelligence, it is<br>
                sometimes described as the effect.<br>
                Artificial intelligence acquires information through practical practices,<br>
                 and is able to accurately distinguish between multiple issues One of the most<br>
                  important capabilities of artificial intelligence is its response to variables,and<br>
                   is characterized by flexibility and speed of reaction in all situations.
                Artificial intelligence has its ability to perceive, and thus make decisions properly,<br>
                 depending on studying all the possibilities and mastering its results, and then choosing<br>
                  the best decisions that lead to the desired results.<br>
                Quickly be able to detect and correct errors, and make better improvements in the future.<br>
                It can be said that artificial intelligence started with the development of some different<br>
                 computer programs
